## Recreating the Experiment

You can easily recreate the experiment on a cloud platform like **Google Colab** without any hassle. Simply download the repository and upload the notebook file from your device.

However, if you want to go the extra mile and run the experiment locally, follow these steps:

---

### ðŸ”§ Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env_name
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment (Windows)

```bash
source env_name/Scripts/Activate
```

ðŸ’¡ For macOS/Linux, use:

```bash
source env_name/bin/activate
```

### ðŸ“¦ Step 3: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
