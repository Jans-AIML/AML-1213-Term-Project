In this NoteBook, the statistical analysis will be performed around data from binding free energy (deltaG) collected for different molecular targets interacting with 
several bioactive compounds. The deltaG values from the experiment and two computational methods (FEP and TI) are compared, using regression analysis, and grouped according to 
molecular target.Â¶ The variance and covariance are calculated for the whole data in two sets of computational calculations.
